# 🧑‍💻 CS50 Python – Week 1: Return Values – Name Formatter

This is a simple Python program that asks the user for their name, removes extra whitespace, capitalizes each word properly, and greets them.

It's part of my learning journey through the **[CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/)** course by Harvard University.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11.9**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Markdown (.md) for documentation**

## ⚙️ How to Run This Program

Follow these steps to run the `return_values.py` script:

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/elkinvenegas/cs50-python-projects.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the project folder:

```
cd cs50-python-projects/week_1_functions
```

### 3. Run the script

```bash
python return_values.py
```
If you're on **macOS or Linux**, and `python` doesn't work, try:

```bash
python3 return_values.py
```

### 4. Interact with the program

When prompted:

```
What's your name?
Type your name, for example: 
`     pepe smith   ` (with whitespaces and lowercases)
You should see the following output:
Hello, Pepe Smith
```

📘 **What I Learned in This Exercise**

✅ How to ask for user input using `input()`
✅ How to remove leading/trailing spaces with `.strip()`
✅ How to capitalize each word using `.title()` and the difference with `.capitalize()`, which is for first letter only.
✅ How to chain multiple string methods in one line
✅ How to print formatted output using `f-strings`

This exercise helped reinforce basic **input/output, string methods**, and writing **cleaner Python code**.
